This program was about to print the flag when it died. Maybe the flag is still in this core file that it dumped? Also available at /problems/core_0_28700fe29cea151d6a3350f244f342b2 on the shell server.

Hints:

What is a core file?
You may find this reference helpful.
Try to figure out where the flag was read into memory using the disassembly and strace.
You should study the format options on the cheat sheet and use the examine (x) or print (p) commands. disas may also be useful.
