In this challenge, as soon as we ls the challenge directory, we see that theres a file there with the name "." so we resort to the manpage of ls as suggested and see that theres this option:

	-Q, --quote-name
              enclose entry names in double quotes
Which runnig gives us that the file name is actually ".  ", and we can simply 'cat' is.
