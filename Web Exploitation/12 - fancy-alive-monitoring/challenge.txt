One of my school mate developed an alive monitoring tool. Can you get a flag from http://2018shell1.picoctf.com:8587 (link)?

Hints:

This application uses the validation check both on the client side and on the server side, but the server check seems to be inappropriate.
You should be able to listen through the shell on the server.
