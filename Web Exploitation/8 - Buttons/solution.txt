This challenge we get a page with a button that refers us to the second button and upon pressing it we get rick rolled. 
The hist says that we need to check whats the difference between the two, and the first one is submitted as a form via POST, and the secont one is just a href link. so we break on the button2.php request and change it from GET to POST, and get the flag.
