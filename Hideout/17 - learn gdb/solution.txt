We get a file and an instruction to learn gdb. Were in luck that we learned GDB before and we can jump right into the action. so we run gdb, and start investimagating the ELF, with info func, and see that we have the symbols for the functions, and first jump into main to get a feel for the calling order.
Without getting into whats happening, we see that the executable calls setv, puts, decrypt_flag, and puts. since we ran the executable, we saw the message were getting lets not see where in the program these messages are printed out so we could put a breakpoint where needed. 
So somewhere between the first and the second puts, we have the flag decrypted, and ofcourse we peek inside the decrypt_flag function. We see that theres a variable called flag_buf that is probably the buffer that holds the flag. so lets try and see where we can put a breakpoint to see whats inside flag_buf.
Im definig a breakpoint right after decrypt_flag and see if the flag_buf is populated with the flag, and indeed it is.
