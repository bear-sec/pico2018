In this challenge were presented with a login page that we need to pass as an admin.
We are suggested that it passes any regular user login without any password check, so we try and login with a regular user. We can see that after we request the /login page, theres another request to /flag page, and to this page we see that our browser sends some values in the cookie, since we control the cookie we can change the admin value to True and try again. So we stop the outgoing requests and modify admin=True, and voila, we got the flag!
