We connect to the supplied address and find a greeting with some rules and an example of how to solve the equations give there. I couldnt pin point an exact algorithm but from the rules and examples we need to write something (in python maybe?), to solve these equation. So i did it, and chose to write a recursive function that adds the parts together from left to right cause that was easier to implement. 
The function basically tries to find which part should "eat" the other, based upon the depth of the brackets. 
My first try was to just count the number of adjacent brackets, so for example '((())(())())' vs '((()))' would result in right to eat left, since left has 2 bracket on the right side, and left has 3. but in fact that need to be added up, cause the depth of brackets on the left side is 3.
I realized my mistake when the second to last stage had slightly more involved cases, that my script couldnt solve, so i turned to the drawing board again.
