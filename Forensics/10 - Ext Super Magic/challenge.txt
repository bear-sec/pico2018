We salvaged a ruined Ext SuperMagic II-class mech recently and pulled the filesystem out of the black box. It looks a bit corrupted, but maybe there's something interesting in there. You can also find it in /problems/ext-super-magic_1_c544657e659accef770d3f2bc8384a8c on the shell server.

Hints:

Are there any tools for diagnosing corrupted filesystems? What do they say if you run them on this one?
How does a linux machine know what type of file a file is?
You might find this doc helpful.
Be careful with endianness when making edits.
Once you've fixed the corruption, you can use /sbin/debugfs to pull the flag file out.
