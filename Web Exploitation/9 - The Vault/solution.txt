We get yet another login anel that we need to pass. This time we also get the source code of the backend application. we see that theres a regular expression pattern check that calidates that we dont input ' OR '1'='1., and we need to think of some query that wont match this.

we try to login with the admin user, terminate the query, and mark the rest as comment, without the password check. supplying this string:
admin'; --
thus the resulting query will be:
"SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE name='admin'; -- AND password='bloop'";
this will cause the query to just check the username and the rest of it will be a comment.
