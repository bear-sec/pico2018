we see at this page some familiar faces but we need to login as admin. so we go to the admin login panel and try the first value that comes to mind, admin:admin.
The login fails, so we try and check for sqli, maybe it handles it poorly andwe can get an error, so we put in a single bracket, and we get a 500! cool, now lets try a basic sqli that bypasses the password check.
In this sqli we assume that the query that the backend performs is as follows:

'SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name=' . user_name . ' AND password=' .pasword

so what we can do is set the password to "a' OR '1'='1"
and the resulting query will be:

'SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name='admin' AND password='a' OR '1'='1'

and what it does is retrieves the user where user_name=admin, and a TRUE statement, the password fails, but the '1'='1' succeeds so the query outputs the relevant data and we get the flag.
