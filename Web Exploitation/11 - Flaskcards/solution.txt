In this challenge we get a link to a web app that you can log into and leave cards, and read them. First thing is to try find out whats the backend of that application to try and find vulnerabilities that are relevant to this app. the name of the challenge gives it away, i know that we have SSTI with flask, we can check where there isnt any input validation. 
we will try and create a user with a template in its username. with no luck. 
Lets try and craete a card with some expression to evaluate, like 1+2, so we put in the name {{ 1+2 }}
and bam, we get a 3.
now lets get something interesting like the config: {{ config }}
and heres the flag.
