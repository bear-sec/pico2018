we are presented with an application that does nothing, but has a login option. in the source we can see some comments with different usernames each time that we can user later.
in the log in screen we see that you can choose that you forgot your password, se lets try to reset the admin password. 
no success, user does not exist, well lets try the users we found in the comments. and success.
were presented with what seems to be random questions. the vulnerability here is that there is no global counting of failed questions. so we can constantly retry the same question until we find the answer. after we succeed with one of the questions, since they are random we can get the same question after we just answered it and since we know the answer already we can just reset the password.
