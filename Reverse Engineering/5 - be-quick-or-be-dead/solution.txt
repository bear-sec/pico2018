first thing is we check whats in main, and we see 4 consecutive calls to 4 funtions: header, set_timer, get_key, print_flag.
running the app just hangs, and reaches a timeout that was set presumably in set_timer so we will need to avoid that, or just fix the hanging.
lets see whats in header:

just printing the title of the challenge.
set_timer sets the function alarm_handler to run after 1 second and terminate the program, we can skip this call by patching the program.
get_key is where the program hangs, so lets investimagate. (Investimagate, verb: to investigate, but with the added implication of shenanigans to be had)
inside the function theres a function call to calculate_key, maybe this is what hanging the program, lets see whats inside. 
a loop while var_4 < 0xdfea967a, it adds one to it. *sigh*
we can set cs:key global var to 0xdfea967a and skip the call to it.
doing so gives us the flag.
Lets implement this in gdb, but first create a checklist of what we need to do so that the program will run:
- skip set_timer in main
- skip calculate_key
- set cs:key = 0xdfea967a in get_key
