We get another login screen that has a flag button that supposedly will give the flag only if the one pressing it is and admin. The hint says it has to do with the cookie, so lets check the site and see what we can do. We see that when you press the button it sends a request to /flag, and returns a jwt cookie saying were not admin, so lets try adding that we indeed are.
And it worked, we got the flag.
